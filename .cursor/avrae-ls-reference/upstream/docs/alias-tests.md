# Alias and gvar tests

Alias tests and gvar tests let you run mock Avrae code and compare the result to what you expect. They are small text files that live next to your alias or gvar files.

## Quick start

1. Create an alias file such as `greet.alias`, or a gvar module such as `helpers.gvar`.
2. Create a test file next to it such as `greet.alias-test` or `helpers.gvar-test`.
3. Run tests:

```bash
avrae-ls --run-tests
```

## File layout and discovery

Tests are discovered by filename. The runner scans for:

- `*.alias-test`
- `*.aliastest`
- `*.gvar-test`
- `*.gvartest`

You can run tests in a folder or point to a single test file:

```bash
avrae-ls --run-tests .
avrae-ls --run-tests path/to/greet.alias-test
avrae-ls --run-tests path/to/helpers.gvar-test
```

Example layout:

```
my-aliases/
  .avraels.json
  greet.alias
  greet.alias-test
  helpers.gvar
  helpers.gvar-test
  combat/
    roll.alias
    roll.alias-test
```

### How the alias file is chosen

The test file sits next to the alias file it targets. The test command decides which alias to load:

- `!greet` looks for `greet`, `greet.alias`, or `greet.txt` in the same folder.
- If the test file name starts with `test-`, that prefix is ignored when finding the alias file.

If you keep aliases and tests side by side, you rarely need to think about this.

### How the gvar file is chosen

The gvar test file targets a sibling `.gvar` file with the same stem:

- `helpers.gvar-test` loads `helpers.gvar`
- `foo-bar.gvar-test` loads `foo-bar.gvar`


## Test file format

Each test has three sections:

1. The command to run (starts with `!`).
2. A separator line: `---`
3. The expected result.
4. Optional metadata after a second `---`.

You can repeat this pattern as many times as you like in one file.

### Basic example

```
!greet Ada
---
Hello, Ada!
```

- The command is parsed like a shell command line, so quotes work the way you expect:

```
!greet "Ada Lovelace"
---
Hello, Ada Lovelace!
```

### Multiple tests per file

```
!greet Ada
---
Hello, Ada!

!greet "Ada Lovelace"
---
Hello, Ada Lovelace!

!greet
---
Hello, adventurer!
```

### Numbers and other values

The expected section is YAML/JSON. That means numbers are numbers, lists are lists, and dictionaries are dictionaries.

```
!roll 1d6
---
3
```

### Embed comparison (partial match)

If the alias returns an embed, compare it with a YAML/JSON dictionary. Only the keys you include are checked.

```
!status
---
title: "Status"
description: "All systems go"
fields:
  - name: "HP"
    value: "12/12"
```

- `fields` is compared by order and prefix. If you list two fields, only the first two are checked.
- Extra fields in the actual embed do not fail the test.

### Regex matching

You can use regex in expected strings:

- Full regex: `/.../` or `re:...`
- Mixed literal + regex: only the `/.../` part is regex.

```
!roll 1d20
---
/\d+/
```

```
!greet Ada
---
Hello, /A.*/!
```

### Metadata (vars and character overrides)

Add a second `---` to include metadata. Supported keys:

- `name`: label for reporting.
- `vars`: per-test overrides for `cvars`, `uvars`, `svars`, and `gvars`.
- `character`: values merged into the mock character.

```
!damage 5
---
/\d+ damage/
---
name: "simple-damage"
vars:
  cvars:
    hp: 12
character:
  name: "Test Paladin"
  stats:
    strength: 18
```

### Run-only tests (no expected output)

If you just want to make sure the alias runs without error, leave the expected section blank.

```
!setup
---
---
name: "no-output-check"
```

## Gvar test format

Each gvar test file contains draconic code that runs after the sibling gvar module is implicitly imported with `using(...)`.

```
return helpers.constant
---
"Constant Gvar value"
```

- The sibling `.gvar` stem becomes the imported gvar id.
- The local binding uses the sanitized form of that stem.
  `foo-bar.gvar` becomes `foo_bar`
  `123mod.gvar` becomes `gvar_123mod`
- Gvar tests compare the direct execution result of the test body.

### Multiple gvar tests per file

Use the same repeated block layout, but because there is no `!command` sentinel, include a second `---` before the blank line that separates cases.

```
return helpers.constant
---
"one"
---

return helpers.other
---
"two"
```

- Metadata after the second `---` is optional.
- Leave a blank line between cases.

### Gvar metadata

Gvar tests support the same metadata mapping as alias tests:

- `name`
- `vars`
- `character`

```
return helpers.answer + get('bonus')
---
12
---
name: "adds-bonus"
vars:
  cvars:
    bonus: 7
```

## Common tips

- Expected output cannot include a line that starts with `!` because that marks the next test. If you need to check a `!` line, use a single-line string like `"line1\n!line2"` or a regex like `re:^!`.
- If you want a number treated as text, wrap it in quotes (YAML reads bare numbers as numbers).
- The mock context comes from `.avraels.json` and any var files you configure there (including gvar `{ filePath: ... }` entries). Metadata `vars` and `character` values are merged on top of those defaults for the test only.
- Each test runs independently, so one test does not affect another.
- Alias tests compare against the alias result or embed preview, not stdout.
- Gvar tests compare against the direct test-body result, not stdout.
- Stdout is still shown in the test report to help debug.

## GitHub Actions

This repo ships a composite action that installs `avrae-ls` and runs alias and gvar tests.

1. Create a minimal config file for CI (for example `.github/avrae/ci.avraels.json`):

```json
{
  "enableGvarFetch": true,
  "avraeService": {
    "token": "${AVRAE_TOKEN}"
  }
}
```

2. Add a workflow that uses the action:

```yaml
name: Alias And Gvar Tests

on:
  pull_request:
  push:

jobs:
  alias-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: 1drturtle/avrae-ls@main
        with:
          test-path: .
          config-path: .github/avrae/ci.avraels.json
          avrae-token: ${{ secrets.AVRAE_TOKEN }}
```

- `config-path` defaults to `.avraels.json`. When you point it at another file, the action copies it to `.avraels.json` in the workspace before running tests.
- `avrae-token` is optional unless your tests rely on remote gvars or `verify_signature`. Prefer `${AVRAE_TOKEN}` in config files instead of hardcoding tokens.

## FAQ

**How do I run just one test file?**
Use the file path:

```bash
avrae-ls --run-tests path/to/greet.alias-test
avrae-ls --run-tests path/to/helpers.gvar-test
```

**Can I put many tests in one file?**
Yes. Alias tests can repeat the `command`, `---`, and `expected` blocks. Gvar tests can repeat `body`, `---`, and `expected`, but multi-case gvar files should include the second `---` and a blank line between cases.

**What if I do not care about the output, only that it runs?**
Leave the expected section empty (see "Run-only tests"). That will pass as long as the alias runs without errors.

**How does it find the alias file?**
It looks in the same folder as the test file for the alias name in your command (for example `!greet` matches `greet`, `greet.alias`, or `greet.txt`). If your test file is named `test-greet.alias-test`, it will also try `greet`.

**How does it find the gvar file?**
It loads the sibling `.gvar` file with the same stem as the `.gvar-test` file.

**Can I use JSON instead of YAML?**
Yes. JSON is valid YAML, so JSON objects and lists work in the expected and metadata sections.

**Why is a gvar missing or `using(...)` failing?**
Make sure `.avraels.json` enables gvar fetch and sets a token, or provide the dependency gvar in your var files (inline or with `{ filePath: ... }`) or test metadata under `vars.gvars`. The module under test itself comes from the sibling `.gvar` file.

**How do I ignore gvar fetch failures in CLI runs?**
Use `avrae-ls --run-tests --silent-gvar-fetch` to treat remote gvar fetch failures as `None` without warnings.

**Do tests change my real Avrae data?**
No. The mock runtime does not write back to Avrae. Any variable changes are isolated to a single test run.
